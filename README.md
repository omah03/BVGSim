## 🚌 Key Features

- ** Real-time tracking** of BVG buses and trains using the official BVG API v6
- ** Interactive map** with Leaflet.js showing live vehicle positions across Berlin
- ** Color-coded destinations** for easy route identification and direction tracking
- ** Geolocation support** to find and track nearest vehicles with distance calculations
- ** Individual vehicle tracking** with detailed route information and following mode
- ** Server-sent events** for real-time updates every 3 seconds
- ** Responsive design** optimized for desktop and mobile devices
- ** Live route visualization** with actual BVG line data and stop information
- ** Dynamic line selection** based on vehicle activity and availability (SOON)

##  Tech Stack

### Backend
- **Java 17** with Spring Boot 3.1.4
- **REST API** endpoints for vehicle and route data
- **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** for real-time data streaming
- **BVG Transport API v6** integration for live vehicle radar data
- **Maven** for dependency management and build automation

### Frontend
- **HTML5** with modern CSS3 and responsive design
- **JavaScript ES6+** with Leaflet.js for interactive mapping
- **Geolocation API** for user positioning and distance calculations
- **EventSource API** for real-time updates via Server-Sent Events
- **Leaflet.js** for interactive maps and custom markers

##  Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Java 17 or higher
- Maven 3.6+
- Internet connection for BVG API access

### Running Locally

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/omah03/BVGSim.git
   cd BVGSim
   ```

2. **Build and run:**
   ```bash
   mvn clean package
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

3. **Access the application:**
   - Open your browser to: `http://localhost:8080`
   - Allow location permissions for full functionality

### Docker Deployment

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t bvgsim .

# Run the container
docker run -p 8080:8080 bvgsim
```

## 🌐 Live Deployment

The application is deployed and running live on Railway:
- **Production URL:** https://bvgsim-production.up.railway.app
- **Deployment:** Automated via GitHub integration
- **Infrastructure:** Railway with Docker containerization

## 📱 How to Use

1. ** Select a bus line** from the dropdown menu (shows ONLY most active lines first)
2. ** Choose specific vehicle** or view all vehicles on the selected line
3. ** Enable location tracking** to find nearest buses and calculate distances
4. ** Click vehicle markers** for detailed information including destination and position
5. ** Use the legend** to understand color coding for different destinations
6. ** Works seamlessly** on both desktop and mobile devices

##  API Integration

This application integrates with multiple BVG and Berlin transport APIs:

- **BVG Radar API**: Real-time vehicle positions and movement data
- **BVG Transport API v6**: Route information, schedules, and stop data
- **OpenStreetMap**: Base map tiles and geographic data
- **Geolocation API**: User positioning and distance calculations
